Main Application Handle:
- IoTStarterApplication
  These 3 properties are stored in persistent application data:
  - Auth Token - Set by user on login layout
  - Device ID - Set by user on login layout
  - Organization ID - Set by user on login layout

  These properties depend on current application state
  - Connected - Set when MQTT client connected / disconnected

  - Publish Count - Updated on message publish (accel, text, touchmove)
  - Receive Count - Updated on message arrived (MqttHandler messageArrived callback)

  - Color - Default: Gray, Updated on color message received

Activities:
- Login - Initial activity of the application
- IoT - Sends text, accel or touchmove event messages, displays color command messages on background
- Log - Displays received text command messages

Views:
- DrawingView - Part of IoT Activity, background color based on IoTStarterApplication Color property, allows for
                sending of touchmove messages.

Utils:
- MqttHandler - Perform all MQTT related actions. Send connection loss intents to LoginActivity and message arrived
                intents to IoTActivity
- ActionListener - Process results of MQTT API calls, send connection intents to LoginActivity and message publish
                intents to IoTActivity
- MessageConductor - Process received messages, send color intents to IoTActivity, send text intents to LogActivity
- TopicFactory - Generate command and event topic strings
- MessageFactory - Unused currently
- DeviceSensor - Handle device sensors for accelerometer, magnetometer, orientation
- PayloadAdapter - Format JSON text messages for LogActivity

Intents:
- INTENT_LOGIN - LoginActivity
- INTENT_IOT   - IoTActivity
- INTENT_LOG   - LoginActivity

  The following are sent to LoginActivity by MqttHandler
  - INTENT_DATA_CONNECT - mqtt client connected
  - INTENT_DATA_DISCONNECT - mqtt client disconnected

  The following are sent to IoTActivity by MqttHandler
  - INTENT_DATA_PUBLISHED - message published
  - INTENT_DATA_RECEIVED - message received

  The following are sent to IoTActivity by MessageConductor
  - COLOR_EVENT - color message was received

  The following are sent to LogActivity by MessageConductor
  - TEXT_EVENT - text message was received
